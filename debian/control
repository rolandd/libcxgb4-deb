Description: Userspace driver for Chelsio T4- and T5-based iWARP adapters
 libcxgb4 is a device-specific driver for Chelsio T4- and T5-based
 iWARP (RDMA over IP/ethernet) adapters for the libibverbs library.
 This allows userspace processes to access Chelsio iWARP hardware
 directly with low latency and low overhead.
 .
 This package contains the loadable plug-in.
